  # Gets the data from this r script

# Input: Takes no input.
# Function: Groups the meteorite data by year for meteorites that fell and 
#           meteorites that were found. Creates a new data frame with these 
#           counts and adds a column for the percentage of meteorites that were
#           seen falling.
# Output: Returns the data frame of the year, the number of meteorites seen 
#         falling, the number of meteorites found, and the percentage of 
#         meteorites seen falling.
