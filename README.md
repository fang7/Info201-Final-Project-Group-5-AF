# Exploring Meteorite Data

**Description:** We have created a shiny web app that answers questions about a
dataset containing information about meteorites. Each tab in our app answers
a different question.

**Question 1:** How do meteorites and their locations change over time?

**Question 2:** Is their a relationship between the composition of the meteorites
and the location where they fell?

**Question 3:** In which country were the most number of meteorites found? How
many people did they affect depending on the population of the country?

**Question 4:** How have the technology/resources helped observe meteorites
falling over time?
