           remained constant over time. Unfortunately, the p-value is too large
           and the correlation coefficient is too low to deem this result 
           significant. In conclusion, the percentage of meteorites seen 
           falling over time seems to remain somewhat constant, but the results
           were quite random and not significant.")
